## Ruby Algorithms

This is a repo for Ruby Algorithms that I implement day by day for practice and learn .
Almost every algorithm here are from urionlinejudge.com and you will find the uri link to the description of the problem in the first lines of the code, like this:

```
=begin 
    This is a problem selected from the string algorithms section from URI Online Judge
    URL: https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/pt/problems/view/1168
=end 
number_times = gets
```

### Files
If the name of the files are numbers, it is because it is the number of the problem in URI Online Judge

### Install
Make sure you have ruby installed. And if not, you can access https://rubyinstaller.org/ for windows, or https://www.ruby-lang.org/pt/downloads/ for MAC ou LINUX.
